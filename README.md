# StackOverflowNetworkAnalysis

There are comprehensive studies on how groups form and work together in a face-to-face team work scenario. However, even though the development of the internet has allowed open platforms for collaboration in a massive scale, little research has been conducted on patterns of collaboration in that domain.

This project analyzes the stackoverflow community representing it as a graph. We are applying network analysis methods to subcommunities for libraries like Numpy in order to understand the structure of the community.

In a next stage we are comparing the communities to theoretical network models as well as to real network models to obtain insights about work patterns in the community. Finally we will compare those insights with proven psychological models of group work theorey to gain intuition about knowledge transfer and work in these communites. We will show that the shape of group work and knowledge transfer changes by the means of online communities.
